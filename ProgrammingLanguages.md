# Programming Languages

Favorite:
- Modern C++ ([C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20) or newer)
  - Mostly `std` but the technology behind should always be the same (you can change allocations by `std::vector` but it must always be continuous block of data)
  - `CLion` by JetBrains as IDE
- C# [7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3) / [8.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8), [.NET 4.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#.NET_Framework_4.8) + [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)
  - `Rider` by JetBrains as IDE
    - `VisualStudio` by Microsoft is also an option (not `VS Code`)
    - `MonoDevelop` used to be good but is no longer usable (also known as XamarinStudio)

I also do other "IT languages", not limited to programming (SQL, ~~JavaScript~~) and even have advanced knowledge of HTML+CSS.
Using T-SQL, C# and Delphi at work but use mostly C++20 during my free time.

I prefer GIT for versioning, especially from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)' GUI or command line ([Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) on linux, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows).

I am paying for [JetBrains All Products Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) myself, and I really like it! (not paid promotion)


## Templates

- [C++](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Cpp-Template)
- ~~[C++ with LUA scripting](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Cpp-LUA-Template)~~ - No longer maintained
- ~~[C++ with Vulkan API](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Cpp-Vulkan-Template)~~ - No longer maintained

Those are my repository templates to simplify prototyping (and motivate me to separate projects into smaller parts).
They contain basic CMake project structure and GitHub Actions (Linux + Windows).

## Programming Languages

Favorite:
- Modern C++ ([C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20))
- C# [7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3), [.NET 4.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#.NET_Framework_4.8) + [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)

I also do other IT languages, not limited to programming (SQL, JavaScript) and even have advanced knowledge HTML+CSS.

I prefer GIT for versioning, especially from console ([Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) on linux, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows).

I am paying for [JetBrains All Products Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) (not paid promotion).

# Abit Gray

Hi and welcome!

I am full-time software programmer and free-time game prototype programmer.


## Programming Languages

Favorite:
- Modern C++ ([C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20))
- C# [7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3), [.NET 4.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#.NET_Framework_4.8) + [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)

I also do other IT languages, not limited to programming (SQL, JavaScript) and even have advanced knowledge HTML+CSS.

I prefer GIT for versioning, especially from console ([Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) on linux, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows).

I am paying for [JetBrains All Products Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) (not paid promotion).

## Personal Projects
- [AWEngine](https://github.com/graymadness/AWEngine) - C++20 3D [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) Game Engine
- [Voxelite](https://github.com/voxelite/Voxelite) - 3D Voxel Customizable Game (Server-side mods)
- [Decay](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Decay-Library) / [BspLib](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/BspLib) - GoldSrc (Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6) File (Map, Textures...) Parser
- SoulEater - [Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series))-like combat with customizable content

Ordered by priority.

As you can see, I like user-generated content.
I have no released games as I enjoy prototyping.

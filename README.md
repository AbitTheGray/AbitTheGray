# Abit Gray

Hi, I am full-time software programmer and hobby game and engine (prototype) programmer.

*I know too much to be an optimist and I got burned too often to be a realist. So I became pessimist, and now I do not get many burns anymore.*

*I am lazy, I will do more work now, so I can do less in the future.*

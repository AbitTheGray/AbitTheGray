## Programming Languages

Favorite:
- Modern C++ ([C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20))
- C# [7.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3), [.NET 4.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#.NET_Framework_4.8) + [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)

I also do other IT languages, not limited to programming (SQL, JavaScript) and even have advanced knowledge HTML+CSS.

I prefer GIT for versioning, especially from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)' GUI and console ([Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) on linux, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows).

I am paying for [JetBrains All Products Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) myself and I really like it! (not paid promotion)


## Templates

- [C++](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Cpp-Template)
- [C++ with LUA scripting](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Cpp-LUA-Template)

Those are my repository templates to simplify prototyping (and motivate me to separate projects into smaller parts).


## Fizz-Buzz
Based on [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) game, those are my language showcase projects.

- [C++](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Fizz-Buzz-cpp)
- [C#](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Fizz-Buzz)


## TODO List

There used to be more bullet points with "deadlines" but lately I am running out of time so they were meaningless.

Occasionally I fail to get the motivation to work some of those projects alone and that is why I have multiple open projects.

- [AWEngine](https://github.com/graymadness/AWEngine) with Vulkan Renderer
  - Custom Low-level C++ Game Engine
  - Multiple components (parts) which may be used by output project
- [Voxelite](https://github.com/voxelite/Voxelite)
  - 3D Voxel Customizable Game (Server-side mods)
- [Decay](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Decay-Library) - GoldSrc (Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6) File (Map, Textures...) Parser
  - Remake of [BspLib](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/BspLib) with addition
  - Will probably be extended by JavaScript version (for web)
- SoulEater draft using AWEngine
  - Data from original game
    - Only parse, not to provide the data = must own the game
  - Render with AWEngine
    - Will be perfect benchmark environment for the engine


Postponed until... unknown

- SoulEater draft using [Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
  - [Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series))-like combat with customizable content
  - Parser for [Dark Souls 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls) map and character models
    - Only parse, not to provide the data = must own the game
- [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) Chess
  - Custom script bundle (put on Asset Store for Free)
  - Probably with simple AI (will need research first)

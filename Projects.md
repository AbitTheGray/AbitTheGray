# Projects

This list contains only personal projects.

If the links below do not work, they may be private repositories which I decided to not public (yet).
Not all my projects are listed below, only those I consider mention-worthy.

## Completed

Nothing major yet.

## In-progress

- [Roengenium](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Roentgenium) (+tutorial) - custom GoldSrc engine implementation, OpenGL
- [Yautja costume](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/Yautja) - full Yautja/Predator costume (wireless part communication, animatronics...), ESP32

### Secondary

- [ESP32 RC receiver](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/RC_Receiver) (vehicle side) - 16 PWM outputs (50Hz = RC servos) and I2C (QWIIC)
- [USB PowerDelivery DevKit](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/USB_PD_DevKit) - ESP32-S3, USB OTG, up to 24V input, Power Delivery sink

## Postponed

- [AWEngine](https://github.com/graymadness/AWEngine) - generic Vulkan 3D engine (cancelled)
- [IRC](https://github.com/AbitTheGray/IRC) - IRC protocol implementation (coding practice)
- [Voxelite](https://github.com/voxelite) - Fully customizable "Minecraft clone", server-side modding, custom 3D Vulkan engine

## Planned

### Software

- Bane - [DOOM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/)/[DOOM2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/) multiplayer-focused engine/game + map editor
- GoldSrc map editor ([Valve Hammer Editor](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor) alternative)

### Hardware

- G-scale train - ESP32+Battery with optional power from rails
- Full electronic M41A from Alien franchise (no firing but mechanical feedback)
- USB-C Fan controller (using PowerDelivery for 12V) - potentiometer? temperature sensor? BLE?
- Costume RemoteControlled Universal Module - high-frequency LEDs, speed-controlled fans and BLE controls (maybe even few servo slots)
  - Similar to those seen in [Adam Savage's Tested "Master Chief's Spartan Armor" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJVUSldj2SQ)

### Far Future

### Software

- KiCad automatic export - Export BOM, position files (top/bottom for JLCPCB) and Gerber files (usable by Github Actions and output as artifact)
- Roengenium 2 - "Source variant of Roengenium" (different path of GoldSrc evolution, similar to [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) engine)
- Dark Souls unifying engine (back-to-back Dark Souls 1+2+3, custom weapons/armor/enemies/bosses)

### Hardware

- Laser Tag with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi (WiFi AP and game master)
- Car Radio - audio playback (USB / SD Card), BLE controls, Bluetooth speaker, WiFi device for internet radio, USB-C charging (PowerDelivery?)
- PC PowerDelivery USB-C - Front panel USB-C HUB with Power Delivery (using PC PSU)
- PCIe USB PowerDelivery card
